# Early-Stage Alzheimer's Detection – Model Demo

This notebook provides a **reconstructed demonstration** of the machine learning pipeline used in my
final-year project on early-stage Alzheimer’s disease detection using handwriting-based features.

The focus is on:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature-based classification
- Model evaluation

This is a simplified demo intended for clarity and reproducibility.
